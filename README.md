# Neural-Network-Visual
This is a 3D editor for interacting with and editing Keras deep learning models. It was made for the 2018 SD Hacks and only works as a prototype for multi layer perceptron. The aim of this project was to save the lost souls of those who copy and paste keras models by showing them what they are doing.
